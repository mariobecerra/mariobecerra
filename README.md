### About me

I'm an applied mathematician, data scientist, and computer scientist. My main interests are statistical modeling, data visualization, predictive analytics, and machine learning.

I am currently a doctoral researcher at the [Mechatronics, Biostatistics and Sensors (MeBioS)](https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/mebios) division of the Biosystems Department at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/). My current research focuses on statistics and Bayesian optimal experimental design for choice models.
